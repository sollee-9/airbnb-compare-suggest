### Background
While searching for rooms to book on Airbnb for my upcoming Europe trip, I found myself struggling to decide on the final property to book from my wishlist properties
Airbnb currently offers the option to filter for properties on initial search; however, once properties have been shortlisted using the Wishlist feature, there is no way to easily compare and narrow down the properties

I found myself opening each of the 30+ wishlisted properties on a separate tab and manually going through each to find the most suitable one, carefully considering criteria such as distance from airport, distance to major tourist attractions, price, guest reviews, and more which proved to be a cumbersome process

This inspired me to prototype the “Compare & Suggest” feature in an attempt to address this user problem

### Tech Stack
This project was built with JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, HTML, and Tailwind.css, then deployed on Vercel.
